# ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Management System Using Background Subtraction
ðŸ“Œ Overview

Urban traffic congestion is a growing challenge due to rapid urbanization and increasing vehicle numbers. Conventional traffic signals follow static timing, which leads to unnecessary waiting, wasted fuel, and delays â€” especially problematic for emergency vehicles.

This project proposes an Intelligent and Adaptive Traffic Signal Management System using:

Background Subtraction for real-time vehicle detection and traffic density estimation.

RFID technology for automatic emergency vehicle prioritization.

Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno for embedded control and signal switching.

By dynamically adjusting traffic signal timing based on real-time vehicle density and prioritizing emergency vehicles, this system aims to reduce congestion, travel time, and environmental impact.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

âœ… Real-Time Vehicle Detection:
Uses background subtraction algorithms to detect moving vehicles from live camera feeds.

âœ… Dynamic Signal Timing:
Allocates signal duration to each lane proportionally to traffic density, with categories for high and low traffic.

âœ… Emergency Vehicle Priority:
Detects ambulances and other emergency vehicles using RFID readers and switches signals automatically to clear their path.

âœ… Embedded Implementation:
Prototype built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, webcams, RFID readers/tags, LEDs, and LCD displays.
