# 📊 Results
This folder contains the experimental results, visual outputs, and performance evaluations for the Smart Traffic Management System Using Background Subtraction.

✅ What’s included

➡️ Vehicle detection accuracy:

Plots and tables comparing actual vs. detected vehicle counts.

➡️ Prototype screenshots:

Images showing the hardware prototype with toy vehicles, RFID detection, and signal switching.

➡️ Performance graphs:

Accuracy trends over time

Signal timing vs. lane density

📈 Summary

Average detection accuracy: ~85%

Emergency vehicle response: Verified with RFID tags and readers in prototype setup.

Dynamic allocation: Proper time allocation for low vs. high-density lanes demonstrated with toy cars.

📂 How to use

Open the plots to understand how the detection performs over time.

Review images for a visual proof of the prototype working.

Use data to compare detection output with ground truth if you replicate the experiment.

🔖 Note

All results shown here are based on a small-scale prototype with toy vehicles. Real-world deployment may show variation due to weather, lighting, and camera positioning.
