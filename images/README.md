# ðŸ“Š Experimental Results
Prototype: Built using toy vehicles and cardboard intersections.

Accuracy: Average vehicle detection accuracy ~85% despite shadow interference.

Emergency Response: RFID-based detection reliably switches signals for ambulances.

Dynamic Allocation: High-density lanes get longer green signals, minimizing idle time for low-density lanes.
